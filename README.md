# Shadow Blocks Reloaded

A Haskell practice project where I try to recreate the Shadow Blocks (a.k.a. Sokoban Game) in Haskell.

To be honest, I do not know if I can maintain this as I seem to have reached a dead and due to limitations of the Gloss graphics library, I may recreate the project using a proper game engine.

## Progress

- **10/11**: The player can now properly move, although mostly everything is still hardcoded in `Main.hs`. May want to create better abstraction for this purpose but I am still trying to figure out how.
